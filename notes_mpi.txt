General format: 
	rc = MPI_Xxxxx(parameter, ...)

Compiling:
	mpic++ -o hello hello.cc
	mpirun [-oversubscribe]
		[-use-hwthread-cpus]
		-np <N> hello

Communicators:
	MPI_COMM_WORLD is the predefined comm.
	
	Every process within a communicator has its own rank (0,1,...,N) and they are used to specify source and destination of messages.

Ordering:
	MPI guarantess that if M1 and M2 are sent with this order, they'll be received in this order.

Messaging:
MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm)

MPI_Recv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype,
int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)

	source : can be set to MPI_ANY_SOURCE
	tag : uniquely identify a message and can be set to MPI_ANY_TAG.
	status : contains additional information about the sender and message tag

MPI_Ssend and MPI_Rsend are the blocking versions of the methods. MPI_Sendrecv blocks until the sending buffer has been totally transferred and arrived at the receiving buffer.
