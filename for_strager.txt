Hi strager! I'll try to synthetize everything here. You can read the GitHub description to get what this project is about. 
I've decided to modulate my code (which is not that big as you can see) creating a class for each of the core phase of the overall process. For a better understanding I suggest starting from the main files in the source directory (which are the three allQueries_* files). You can skip the OpenMP and MPI folder. There are for sure many points where code could be cleaner. Also you can see that there are three python scripts to automate some tasks (what I'm more concerned of is run.py which is used to run with a variable number of MPI processes and OpenMP threads and a max. number of iterations to collect data). These anyway don't need to be prioritized.
Finally if you got time I'd like also an overall revision of the project structure (for which I still lack some skills), specially the cmake files which can be improved for sure.
Thanks a lot in advance for what you do and sorry for my maccheroni english.
